            <h2>Core</h2>
            Bloom is an experiment in working with chatGPT to develop a LIMS from scratch. Bloom is meant to be a useful operational system and a tool to help explore the problem space (and guide development in a tighter feedback loop).
            <b><small>Architecture docs will follow, but for now, the following points are worth noting.</small></b>
            <ul>
                <button class="accordion">...more</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bloom provides a model of the core LIMS objects and concepts & a way to mess with the models in near real time.</li>
                        <li>Provided UIs are functional for base needs. Elaborate for your use cases will need to be developed.</li>
                        <li>Beyond UIs, even for applications like dashboards, Bloom offers a handful, but complex dashboards are expected to be built with projects like <a href="https://superset.apache.org/">superset</a>.</li>
                        <li><a href="/euid_details?euid=AY1">Audit logs</a>, for all details about every object. No data is lost or deleted.</li>
                        <li>Objects each have one EUID.</li>
                        <li>Barcode printing of EUIDs is EXPECTED by Bloom. Out of the box, Bloom will manage printing to ZPL printers. Printer config can be found in the admin view.</li>
                        <li>UI does not include highly error-prone operations like: DRAGGING and DROPPING, and discourages manual entry of data.</li>
                        <li>Once a sample is accessioned, all downstream EUID use should be handled by automated systems or scanning.</li>
                        <li>The UI offers the ability to navigate through all objects and their relationships.</li>
                        <li>Complex actions may be defined for objects.</li>
                        <li>Objects are modeled without taking conceptual shortcuts.</li>
                        <li>ie: containers and the things in containers are modeled independently, as are plates and wset.child_instance.json_addl.get.</li>
                        <li>Oversimplifying the core model to solve for this complexity is, I believe, a core reason most LIMS stink.</li>
                        <li>Development has focused on establishing the feasibility of this approach. Safety nets coming. In the meantime, it is possible to wedge the system (more so in the graph).</li>
                        <li>Bloom objects all adhere to a common set of interfaces, you can get a sense of this from the <a href="/euid_details?euid=AY1">object detail</a> pages. The entire dataset can be navigated from here.</li>
                        <li>'Batches' or 'sets' of any group of objects may be created, and this batch/set can be used to interact/monitor/etc this batch. (not used by BLOOM, but designed)</li>
                        <li>Bloom UI is easily skinnable for those needing different color schemes for usability. These can be switched between in the admin view.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </ul>
            <h2><a href="/assays?show_type=accessioning">ACCESSIONING</a></h2>
            UI design is functionally complete and could serve in production. However, it is demonstrating the finest level of control Bloom offers, and a high throughput scenario would be well advised to aggregate many operations when skinning a lower touch experience.

            UI design is functionally complete and could serve in production (with the same caveats described above applying). The two (example assay/queue/workset)'s are not intended for production use. They demonstrate how the Bloom objects can be combined to define types of work, manage this work, and monitor/report.

                <li>All questions re: deployment, backup, etc. As the system is fully in the user's hands, they can dictate all of these details. FWIW, the core is PostgreSQL, and there are well-established management protocols for queue.child_instance.b_sub_type.</li>
                <li>Regulatory and Compliance: Bloom can meet any/all regulatory requirements. But, similar to the point above, this depends on how you deploy and manage it. Is it able to comply with CAP/CLIA? 100%.</li>
